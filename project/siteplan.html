        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>With a staggering high unemployment rate the Zimbabwean economy has become more informal than formal. Hence Business and Investment Resource hub provides insites into the Zimbabwean economy. Our purpose is to provide more enlightenment in business management, real estate, risk management and entrepreneurship. We also feature tools like ROI calculators, property comparison charts and mini case studies.</p>

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Many young people struggle to find jobs. A business resource hub can provide tools, ideas, and mentorship for entrepreneurs which is the main survival path. There is limited access to business knowledge. A site like this would bridge the gap and empower individuals to make informed decisions on investments. Also Zimbabweans are very entrepreneurial from trading, farming to techstartups. A business hub like this would give them a structured resource and inspiration. Last but not least with a very big diaspora community that often invests back home. A well built hub would attract diaspora investors seeking vetted opportunities.</p>
